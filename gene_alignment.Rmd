# Gene alignments: quick and dirty

## First, collect your genes


Go on [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and scan for the species you're looking for.





```{r, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 12, echo = FALSE}
```

## Second, align them

Go on [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) alignment online tool.

## Third, wrap them up in your favourite format

### File conversion

You can use this simple [File converter](http://sequenceconversion.bugaco.com/converter/biology/sequences/fasta_to_nexus.php) tool to quickly switch between `FASTA` and `NEXUS`.
